ANN CHURN PREDICTION PROJECT
===========================

Project Description
-------------------
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
Customer churn refers to whether a customer will stay with the company or leave the company.
The model is trained on a churn dataset and learns patterns from customer attributes to
make accurate predictions.

The complete project is divided into three major parts:
1. Model Training
2. Model Prediction
3. Model Deployment using Streamlit


1. Model Training
-----------------
- The churn dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
- Data preprocessing includes:
  * Handling missing values
  * Encoding categorical variables
  * Feature scaling
- An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is built using deep learning techniques.
- The model is trained on historical customer data.
- The trained model learns relationships between customer features and churn behavior.
- After training, the model is saved for later use in prediction.


2. Model Prediction
-------------------
- The saved ANN model is loaded.
- New customer input data is provided to the model.
- The model predicts whether the customer:
  * Will stay with the company
  * Will leave (churn)
- The prediction is displayed in a user-friendly format.


3. Model Deployment (Streamlit)
-------------------------------
- Streamlit is used to build a web-based user interface.
- Users can enter customer details through input fields.
- The ANN model processes the input data in real time.
- The churn prediction result is shown instantly.
- This makes the model easy to use for non-technical users.
